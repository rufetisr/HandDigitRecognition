#Hand Digit Recognition Project

**Introduction**
This project focuses on creating a custom dataset and training a model to recognize hand digits from images. I took a structured approach to dataset creation, preprocessing, augmentation, and model selection to achieve reliable performance.

**Dataset Creation**
To create the dataset, I used Roboflow for its robust tools for annotation and augmentation. I manually labeled hands and fingers in each image, ensuring precise annotations to allow the model to learn effectively. The dataset comprises 117 images, including both original images and augmented versions.
